          錯誤: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 1.69 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 31.74 GiB of which 945.12 MiB is free. Process 1887143 has 8.12 GiB memory in use. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 22.69 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 21.04 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 1.29 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
